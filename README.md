# Team Generator

https://github.com/vi3t4lov3/Professional-README-Generator

## Description

this project was to create a command line program that would dynamically generate an HTML webpage based on user inputs. The two Javascript libraries used to achieve this were inquirer and fs. By utilizing Javascript alone a quick file generator was able to be created that utilized new concepts like command line user interaction and file creation.
